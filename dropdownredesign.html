           around the edit text option to prompt it to read the options, and it did not. After I clicked the “Paragraph Styles”
            option, the VoiceOver read “3 items Paragraph Styles”. This was not the most accessible because there are so many 
            options to click on the page and it would be hard to know where this option was. 
          </td>
        <td>When you enter the Netflix website, the VoiceOver starts by reading the top menu bar from left to right. Then it 
          moves to the line below the menu bar and reads after the “Movies” option “Genres, menu pop up collapsed, button”. 
          This seemed like the most accessible since the user might not know where this option is.

        </td>

                I added a lot of functionality with the keyboard that was not present initially. Originally, the up and 
    down arrows didn’t control the menu, but the place of the cursor on the document. I changed it so that 
    the arrows control how the menu is scrolled through, which is more beneficial for keyboard users. I am 
    choosing an increase in accessibility even if it makes learnability a little less.

                In the state where the drop down is selected, the 
                drop down looks pressed and the current option is focused with a red outline and a drop shadow. 
                It is improved because the option that the mouse or keyboard is on looks selected. This version 
                of the component affects learnability because wherever your mouse is on the menu is highlighted. 
                This seemed like an obvious choice to make. The user just needs to remember a “+” means the menu 
                can extend which is common in current day apps.

We have been told to reconsider whether the aforementioned method of toggling between them is intuitive and quick enough - especially for a user trying to toggle between non-consecutive tasks. While the carousel view introduced playfulness to the HCI and matched the companys visual branding, it was rather impractical. Upon reflecting on what should be prioritized when developing interfaces - in UI/UX dev, function over form! - we have decided to remove the carousel completely and display the tasks independently.')">
                This will be a big improvement to accessibility 
                for when the keyboard is used. If you are using a keyboard, you will now be able to tab to the 
                paragraph styles drop down, which would be more efficient.

        <h2>...REFLECTION...</h2>
        <p>Netflix did well by making then “Genre” category look different every state it was in. When it was 
            hovered over, it was noticeable which makes it easier to track the cursor. I implemented this feature 
            in my design for another application.</p>
          <p>A text box on the Netflix website was transparent. The text stood out on the page but the text box was 
            not filled, which makes me believe it might be hard to see in some cases. I chose a color that contrasted 
            well with the background so it would stand out.</p>
          <p>Most computer users in my generation are able to track their cursor and have precise control on their
             mouse pad. Pages seems to be designed without others who cannot do this. Pages didn’t indicate if the
              cursor was hovering over an option on the menu. I made this change so the cursor is easier to track. 
              I also made it more visible when the drop down menu was selected.
          </p>
          <p>The VoiceOver function did not work with Pages well for people who needed to use the keyboard only
             because the user couldn’t tab through the drop down menu. The drop down menu on Netflix was more 
             accessible because you could use the arrows to scroll through the list.</p>
          <p>I think people who could use the mouse are most prioritized. This would impact the user experience 
            negatively if someone has limited mobility in their hands.</p>
