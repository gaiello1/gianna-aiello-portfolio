            <h2>...PROJECT INTRODUCTION...</h2>
            <h3>I wanted to build a sensing system for plants to keep them healthy. SoilSense is aimed at everyday plant owners who often struggle to
                 keep their plants healthy due to busy schedules or simply not knowing when their plants need attention. Itâ€™s also great for anyone who
                  enjoys gardening indoors, people living in apartments or urban areas with limited space, and even tech enthusiasts who want to integrate
                   more smart devices into their homes. The idea is to create a simple, easy-to-use gadget that helps people take better care of their plants 
                   by tracking light intensity, moisture, humidity, and temperature. The main goal is to make plant care less of a guessing game and more about giving your plants exactly what they need.
