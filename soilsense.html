              <li>The entry is processed when the lock button is pressed</li>

        <h2>Here is what I observed...</h2>
        <div id="text">
          <p>Users seem to first check the door to see if it is unlocked. The door handle moves, but the user has to lean into the door to see if it will open. 
            Users who are in a rush are more likely to push harder on the door in this stage.
    
            Users seem to press the buttons with their right pointer finger or right thumb. When locking the door, some seem to wait until the sound 
            finishes of the door locking to leave, while others trust that the door will lock. I noticed that you can enter as many numbers as you want. 
            Most users enter the code quickly and the button locations represent a pattern.

  <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: italic;">I was surprised to find people were relatively satisfied with the interface. This makes sense since
    the keypad lock is popular these days, especially as remote controlled door locks become more 
    common with security systems.</p></div>
